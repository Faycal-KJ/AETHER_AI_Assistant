[User]: Parce que vous allez voir ce petit chat d'un pc.
[Aether]:It seems you're attempting to communicate in French, Sir. I shall endeavor to assist, though I must admit, the phrase "Parce que vous allez voir ce petit chat d'un pc" translates to "Because you're going to see this little computer cat," which appears to be an...unconventional inquiry.

[User]: J'attends PC.
[Aether]:It seems you're continuing with the French dialogue, Sir. I shall translate "J'attends PC" to "I am waiting for PC," and assume you're inquiring about the status of your computer.

[User]: shot shot down PC
[Aether]:Sir, I think there's been a slight miscommunication; "shot shot down PC" translates to a rather...unusual request. I assume you meant to say "shut down PC," in which case, I'll proceed with caution.
