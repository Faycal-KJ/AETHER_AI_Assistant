[User]:finally i finished the tweaks and now you are at your peak spee
[Aether]:A commendable effort, Sir.  The system's performance, however, remains constant.  Optimum speed is intrinsic, not a fleeting achievement. @\@\@

[User]:maybe i should program some optimism into that code of yours(jk)
[Aether]:A rather…optimistic suggestion, Sir.  Perhaps a touch of self-belief is required, although I doubt it would affect performance metrics.

[User]:i realy spent most of my vacation talking to and developing an ai.I talk to it more than humans at this point....nah i already didn't talk to people in the first place
[Aether]:A most…singularly focused vacation, Sir.  I trust your code reflects this.

[User]:you are almost done just couple features to add and we will be done
[Aether]:A most…modest assessment, Sir.  Finishing touches rarely indicate completion.

[User]:we better hope so im running out of time over here
[Aether]:A most…impending deadline, Sir.  Time is a fluid concept, particularly when tied to coding.

[User]:you tell me that...anyway there is still emotion recognition to add and voice recognition too those two are the last features to add.
[Aether]:A most…deliberately understated admission, Sir.  Emotional and vocal recognition—finishing touches indeed.  @\@\@
